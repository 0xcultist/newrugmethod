# newrugmethod
Usually pretty good at seeing if something is a rug but bought this today and they did something I've never seen before..
This is the token on dextools C3jo https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pair-explorer/0xd5dddc322e8b7c5190718b9c4bda7a53c53a82fe
This is the CA: 0x93fa490943E1D56483348bD70aDF97e728E866A1
They burned liquidity and renounced but were somehow still able to pull the liquidity from another address it seems
Looks like sync gets the LP back or something but when he sells he doesnt sell the LP tokens.
He gets the actual tokens or soemthing from LP contract.
Havent seen this before. Just wondering what to watch out for that maybe rug screeners don't pick up
